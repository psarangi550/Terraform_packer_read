# Building Automated Machine Image using Hashicorp packer

- Although `Hashicorp packer` is not a `new technology` , we have been seeing the `Hashicorp packer` lately , as we are building , `automation and image factories` as a part of `larger engagements`

- the `biggest causes` of `increase in hashicorp packer` is because of `adoption of public cloud` and `multi cloud organization`

- as we are `migrating the workload `from  `new platform` , organisation are learning `Hashicorp packer` in order to help manage `like for like images` accross both 
  
  - `on-prem platform` such as `Openstack` or `VMWare`

  -  `one or more cloud platform` to which they are `migrating`

- we can create the `image factory` and `to automate this process` from `start to finish` so that other can concerntrate on `more important task`

- **course objectives**
  
  - `introduction to hashicorp packer`
  
  - `why people want to use hashicorp packer`
  
  - `what problem hashicorp packer going to solve` and `usecases`
  
  - how the `template` and `other component` make up for the `hasicorp packer solution` 
  
  - how to `install` and `operationalize`  `Hashicorp packer` on a `local machine` or `CICD platform` to make the `automation of hashicorp packer solution`
  
  - we will then learn about the `hashicorp packer componsent` such as
    
    - `builder` 

    - `provisioner`

    - `communicator`
    
    - `all those component of hashicorp packer`
    
    - `code organization and versioning ` (as we are create the hashicorp packer tempplate , it is very important to use VC or VCS  something like `GitHub and GitLab` in order to `commit and version` packer template)
    
    - `cloud platform` and `on-premises` integration 
    

- **Course Agenda**
  
  -  Dive Deep into the introduction of hashicorp packer
  
     - what is `Hashicorp packer`
     
     - the `use cases `
     
     - `all the different core component` that make of `hashicor packer`
  - How to `Write Packer Template`
  
    - packer both support `JSON` and `HCL` , we will be `focusing on the HCL` as `that is the future of packer` 

  - will be going to dive down to each one component of `Hashicorp packer` 
    
    - `Builder`
    
    - `Variables`
    
    - `Provisioners`
    
    - `Post-Processors`
    
  - `code organization` :- it is very important to `commit` these `packer template` and versioning them into a `VCS solution` and How to optimize that 
  
  - `ingetration of hashicorp packer solution` into the `CICD pipeline`
  
  - How to `integrate hashicorp packer` to create `an image factory` so that `we can create` the `image` accross `multiple platform`
  
  - other `usescases` of `packers` 
    
    - here we will be seeing `How to create images or things like that` in the `public cloud platform` or `VMware`
    
    - but packer can also create the `Docker Images` and other `cool uses` as well in this case
